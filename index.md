Hi!
I'm Joey Steele, a graduate student at Georgia Tech studying Music Technology.
I have a broad array of interests in computing, especially (but not limited to!) as it relates to music.
I'm especially interested and skilled in digital signal processing, low-level programming, and musical interfaces.

Outside of classes and research, I sing and play piano passionately.
I'm the president of and a member of Georgia Tech Chamber Choir.

Please check out my [portfolio](portfolio.html) to learn about some projects I've done.
