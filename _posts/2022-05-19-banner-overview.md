For a while, I've wanted to increase my visibility online, especially professionally.
As a student in Music Technology, it can be somewhat difficult to convey what I know and can do.
Well, a picture is worth a thousand words, so a good personal banner should give a better, more accurate first impression!

It would be easy to search for generic engineer-y, music-y pictures and *yoink* it from someone's Pinterest page.
But that wouldn't accurately describe my set of skills!
By definition, my skills are unique to me, so no random person's picture would do me justice.

Also, I also don't like the idea of using others' artistic work for my own professional gain without paying them, even if it's licensed to be used freely.
And I'd rather undertake this project myself anyway, for free!

## Goals

I'm envisioning a banner image full of cool-looking diagrams, circuits, graphs, and figures.
All of them will be related to the things I have learned or know how to do in music, engineering, math, etc.
I want to be able to scale it up or down as needed, which means I'll make it a vector graphic.

But most of all, I want this project to be fun and enjoyable.
It shouldn't be something to stress about!

## Image Format

I've decided on using SVG as the final format for the image.
SVG is trivial to put on a webpage, it uses a text format that's pretty easy to hand-write as needed, and Inkscape is most compatible with SVG.
I'll use Inkscape to make most of the graphic.
It's what I have, and it's free and open source.

Why would I mention hand-writing things?
Well, I'm going to include a few mathematical graphs, which means I'll be writing code to generate them from a function!

## Series of Posts

Since I'll be working on this off-and-on, I'll be posting updates individually as I go.
I will share anything interesting that comes up, *especially* any code I end up writing.

In my next posts, I'll be generating a graph of a sawtooth wave Fourier series.
See you soon!
