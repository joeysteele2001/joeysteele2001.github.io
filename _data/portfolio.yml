# - name: Electronic Music Synthesis From Scratch
#   date: Summer 2022
#   description: I am currently developing a performant, real-time modular electronic music synthesizer using the Rust programming language.
#     It will include a module for audio spatialization (likely using a mixture of vector- and distance- based amplitude positioning), able to output to an arbitrary number of loudspeakers.
#     I have also tied in ideas from programming language development for use in processing the modules.
#   documentation:
#     - My git repository is not yet public as this project is still in-progress.
#     - I will likely make a couple blog posts about it in the near future.
#   techs:
#   - Rust (programming language)
#   - Real-time audio

- name: Distributed Version Control in the Digital Audio Workstation
  course: Senior Capstone Project
  date: August 2022 - May 2023
  description: |
    In a group of two other students, we created a tool that enables musicians and producers to collaborate on projects in the REAPER Digital Audio Workstation using Git, a Version Control System.
    This project consisted of the following elements:

    * Extensive background research into the space of collaborative music production
    * A Python library to parse and detect the differences in REAPER project files for displaying a "diff" view
    * A plugin in REAPER that adds a user interface for Version Control commands (commit, checkout, merge, etc.)

    My primary contributions lay in the research and diffing phases.

- name: Modular Prelude in C
  course: Laptop Orchestra
  date: Spring 2020
  description:
    I composed a piece of music written for a virtual instrument I designed from scratch in VCV Rack.
    I wrote the semi-unconventional visual score in LilyPond, a LaTeX-like programming language for music score engraving.
    This was completed in the second half of the Spring 2020 semester, immediately after the transition to online classes due to COVID.

    - VCV Rack (simulated modular synth)
    - TouchOSC (mobile phone interface)
    - LilyPond (musical score)

- name: Harpsichord Synthesizer
  course: Audio Technology I
  date: Fall 2020
  description:
    I wrote a synthesizer that loosely models a harpsichord from scratch in PureData, a visual audio programming environment.
    This work was completed at the end of the Fall 2020 semester for the *Audio Technology I* course.
