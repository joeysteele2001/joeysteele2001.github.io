- name: Electronic Music Synthesis From Scratch
  date: Summer 2022
  description: I am currently developing a performant, real-time modular electronic music synthesizer using the Rust programming language.
    It will include a module for audio spatialization (currently using a mixture of vector- and distance- based amplitude positioning), able to output to an arbitrary number of loudspeakers.
    I have also tied in ideas from programming language development for use in processing the modules.
  techs:
  - Rust (programming language)
  - Real-time audio
  - Digital audio synthesis
  - Audio spatialization

- name: Modular Prelude in C
  course: Laptop Orchestra
  date: Spring 2020
  description: I composed a piece of music written for a virtual instrument I designed from scratch in VCV Rack.
    I wrote the semi-unconventional visual score in LilyPond, a LaTeX-like programming language for music score engraving.
    This was completed in the second half of the Spring 2020 semester, immediately after the transition to online classes due to COVID.

  techs:
  - Music Composition
  - VCV Rack (simulated modular synth)
  - TouchOSC (mobile phone interface)
  - LilyPond (musical score)

- name: Harpsichord Synthesizer
  course: Audio Technology I
  date: Fall 2020
  description: I wrote a synthesizer that loosely models a harpsichord from scratch in PureData, a visual audio programming environment.
    This work was completed at the end of the Fall 2020 semester for the *Audio Technology I* course.
